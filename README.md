# substance_use_disorder

The goal of this project is to investigate the socio-demographic factors potentially associated with the risk of a marijuana user developing substance use disorder using a machine learning approach. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, I aim to identify key predictors and improve our understanding of the factors contributing to marijuana use disorder. The methodology I used is based on Rajapaksha et al. (2020), in which the researchers employed LASSO, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting to estimate the chance of developing SUD based on various demographic, behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive risk factors. 

In this project, I will use logistic regression, Lasso logistic regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting The overall performance of the machine learning models will be evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), overall accuracy (i.e., the proportion of overall correct classifications), sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of correct classifications among the SUD instances/true positives), and specificity (i.e., the proportion of correct classifications among the non-SUD instances/true negatives). By comparing these metrics, I aim to determine the most effective machine learning model for predicting the risk of developing marijuana use disorder. This project can inform prevention and intervention strategies, ultimately aiding in addressing the challenges posed by increased marijuana use.
